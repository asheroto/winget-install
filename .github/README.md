- Always gets the latest version of `winget`
- Works on Windows 10, Windows 11, Server 2022

- Does **not** work on Server 2019

## Script Functionality
- Processor architecture is determined for prerequisites (x86/x64 or arm/arm64)
- [Xaml](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.UI.Xaml/) is installed by downloading the **nupkg**, extracting it, and installing the **appx** package
  - Uses version 2.7.3 for compatibility reasons
- [VCLibs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/troubleshoot/developer/visualstudio/cpp/libraries/c-runtime-packages-desktop-bridge#how-to-install-and-update-desktop-framework-packages) is installed straight from the appx package
  - Uses version 14.00 for compatibility reasons
- [winget-cli](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli) is then installed using the latest version from GitHub
- Machine & User **PATH** variables are adjusted to include WindowsApps folder if needed

## Setup

### Method 1 - PowerShell Gallery

- In PowerShell, type
```powershell
Install-Script winget-install -Force
```
- answer **Yes** to all prompts if asked
**Note:** `-Force` is optional, but it will force the script to update if it is outdated.

The script is published on [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/winget-install) under `winget-install`.

### Method 2 - Download Locally and Run

- Download `winget-install.ps1`
- Run the script with `.\winget-install.ps1`
